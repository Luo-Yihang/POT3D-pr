 ### Field solve type:

 OPTION = ss              

 Total number of MPI ranks =            6

 Number of MPI ranks in r =            1
 Number of MPI ranks in t =            2
 Number of MPI ranks in p =            3

 Global mesh dimension in r =          133
 Global mesh dimension in t =          361
 Global mesh dimension in p =          901

 Average # of r mesh pts per rank =  133.0
 Average # of t mesh pts per rank =  180.5
 Average # of p mesh pts per rank =  300.3

 Estimated load imbalance =   0.88 %
